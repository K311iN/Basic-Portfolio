            <p>Hi, I'm Kellin Baldenegro. I'm 29 years old from from Phoenix, AZ. I began my technology career attending the University of Arizona Continuing and Professional Education Coding Program. It was there that I became a true software engineer and web developer. Although I had spent half a year of self-study before enrollment into the bootcamp it was there that I gained the real world skills necesssary to perform in the business of computers.</p>
